# Lab 2: Machine Learning Problem Definition

## Dataset Description
[cite_start]The dataset used for this lab is the **Mobile Price Classification** dataset (specifically the `submission.csv` feature set)[cite: 2371, 2420]. [cite_start]It contains **1,000 mobile device records** with **21 different columns**, including [cite: 2395-2397]:
* **Hardware Specs**: Battery power, clock speed, RAM, and internal memory.
* **Connectivity**: 3G, 4G, Bluetooth, and Wifi status.
* **Physical Specs**: Mobile weight, pixel height/width, and screen dimensions.

## Machine Learning Problem
* [cite_start]**Problem Type**: This is a **Classification** problem[cite: 2365, 2387].
* [cite_start]**Target Variable**: The intended target variable is **`price_range`** (Categorical: 0, 1, 2, or 3)[cite: 2367, 2388].
* **Problem Statement**: The objective is to analyze mobile hardware specifications to predict which of the four price categories a device belongs to[cite: 2368, 2390]. This allows manufacturers to price their products competitively based on technical features[cite: 2385, 2389].

# ARTI 308 - Lab 2: Machine Learning Problem Definition

## Dataset Description
The dataset selected for this lab is the **Mobile Price Classification** dataset. [cite_start]It contains **2,000 entries** with **21 features** [cite: 1183] describing various hardware specifications of mobile phones, such as:
* **RAM**: Random Access Memory in Megabytes.
* **Battery Power**: Total energy a battery can store in one time (mAh).
* **Internal Memory**: Storage capacity in Gigabytes.
* **Touch Screen**: Whether it has touch screen support or not.

## Machine Learning Problem
* [cite_start]**Problem Type**: This is a **Classification** problem[cite: 1153].
* [cite_start]**Target Variable**: The target variable is `price_range`[cite: 1155].
* [cite_start]**Problem Statement**: The goal is to build a model that can predict the price category (0, 1, 2, or 3) of a mobile phone based on its technical specifications[cite: 1156, 1177, 1178]. This will help a new mobile company estimate the market value of their devices relative to competitors.

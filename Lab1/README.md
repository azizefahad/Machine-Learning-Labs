## Objective

The goal of this lab was to configure a robust development environment for Machine Learning tasks. This involved setting up Python via Anaconda, configuring Visual Studio Code as the IDE, and initializing Git for version control.

---

## Completed Tasks

We successfully installed and verified the following components:

| Component | Status | Details |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Anaconda Navigator** | ✅ | Installed base environment and Python interpreter. |
| **Visual Studio Code** | ✅ | Linked with Anaconda and configured for Jupyter Notebooks. |
| **Library Check** | ✅ | Verified installation of `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. |
| **Git Config** | ✅ | Initialized repository and set user credentials (`user.name`, `user.email`). |

## Tools Configured

- **Anaconda Navigator:** For managing environments and packages.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Primary code editor.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive coding and data visualization.
- **Git Bash / Terminal:** For command-line version control.
